However, if you wish to work offline inside your Jupyter Notebook, then you can do so by adding the following line:

init_notebook_mode(connected=True)


import plotly.express as px
df = px.data.gapminder().query("year == 2007")
fig = px.scatter_geo(df, locations="iso_alpha",
                     color="continent", # which column to use to set the color of markers
                     hover_name="country", # column added to hover information
                     size="pop", # size of markers
                     projection="natural earth")
fig.show()
